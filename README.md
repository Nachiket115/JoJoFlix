# JoJoFlix
JoJoFlix is a beginner-friendly movie search app that allows users to find detailed information about any movie using the OMDb API. Users can simply type in a movie name, and the app will display details such as the title, year, genre, director, actors, plot, and IMDb rating, along with the official movie poster.
